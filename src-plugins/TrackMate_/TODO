GUI
- Have a manual spot editing tool in the 3D viewer displayer.
- Have a separate configuration panel that allows for instance 
		- specifying if we want to save the spot snapshot in the xml file;
		- if we want to store data as a zipped xml file
- Add panel allowing to specify what spot features we want to compute. Maybe this should
go in the separate configuration panel. 


Bugs:
- Check if TrackScheme still reports edge deletion problems.
- Unsolvable bug: in TrackScheme, when TrackMate is launched from Fiji, the cells
are not movable???!

Features:
- Implement edge features. Maybe not.


Segmenting:
- Implement the C.elegans algo from Santella et al 2010.
- Implement an algorithm to segment cell imaged in phase-contrast.


Actions:


Track scheme
- Add the ability to name tracks.
- Add a side table to display track features.
- Allow to export side tables content to csv or xls.


Export/Import
- Offer to select displayer at load.
- Save the spot images in the xml file. Maybe not.


Making it available.
- Write wiki doc.
- Publish an application note.
